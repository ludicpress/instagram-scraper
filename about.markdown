## Digital Scholarship at UTM Library

The [Digital Scholarship Unit](https://utm.library.utoronto.ca/digital-scholarship/about) at the [University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) Library](https://library.utm.utoronto.ca/) was established in 2019. The mandate of the Library's Digital Scholarship Unit is to develop and maintain digital projects for the Library by creating and using digital methods, theories, and tools to support curricula and research at the University of Toronto Mississauga.

To that end, this Jekyll website hosted on GitHub pages provides documentation on how to use a static website in digital research. The website is based on the workshop 'Build a Website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages' at UTM Library. This website is maintained by [Chris Young](http://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/chrisyoung/), Coordinator of Digital Scholarship and Librarian.
