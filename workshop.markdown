Does your research require you to build a static website to document your project or disseminate information as part of a knowledge mobilization requirement? In this workshop you will learn how to build a Jekyll static website using GitHub pages. You will learn some command line fundamentals and be introduced to Jekyll, Ruby, Git and GitHub. By the end of the workshop you will have your own Jekyll website hosted on GitHub pages.

For this workshop we are going to build your Jekyll site and then upload it to GitHub using Git commands in your command line interface. Once the Jekyll website repository is uploaded to GitHub, we will configure your Jekyll repository to GitHub pages, which will make your project a live website.

## Final Thoughts
As you become increasingly comfortable with the command line, you will find wget a helpful addition to your digital research toolkit. If there is an entire set of archival documents that you want to download for text mining, if theyâ€™re arranged in a directory and are all together (which is not as common as one might think), a quick wget command will be quicker than scraping the links with Python. Similarly, you can then begin downloading things directly from your command line: programs, files, backups, etc. You will soon find that wget may be a first option for you to research all kinds of web content!
