Welcome to my website for how to use wget in digital research! You will notice there are several sections to the website, including:

The [About](https://ludicpress.github.io/wget/about/) page explains what wget is and why you can use for digital research;  
The [Resources](https://ludicpress.github.io/wget/resources/) page provides some additional tutorial documentation as well as guidelines on internet research and copyright fair dealing in Canada;  
The [Setup](https://ludicpress.github.io/wget/setup/) page covers installation guidelines for Linux, Windows, and OS X users; and  
The [Workshop](https://ludicpress.github.io/wget/workshop/) page outlines a few exercises you can do with wget to build a archive of internet research data for your projects.

Each time there is a significant update to the content on this website I will create a blog post outlining the changes. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
