## Digital Scholarship at UTM Library

The [Digital Scholarship Unit](https://utm.library.utoronto.ca/digital-scholarship/about) at the [University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) Library](https://library.utm.utoronto.ca/) was established in 2019. The mandate of the Library's Digital Scholarship Unit is to develop and maintain digital projects for the Library by creating and using digital methods, theories, and tools to support curricula and research at the University of Toronto Mississauga.

To that end, this Jekyll website hosted on GitHub pages provides documentation on how to use a static website in digital research. The website is based on the workshop 'Build a Website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages' at UTM Library. This website is maintained by [Chris Young](http://sites.utm.utoronto.ca/chrisyoung/), Coordinator of Digital Scholarship and Librarian.

## Static Websites for Digital Research

A static website is a collection of webpages that is delivered to a user's web browser exactly as it is stored. In contract, dynamic websites are collections of webpages generated by a web application. The main differene between static and dymanic websites are that dynamic websites allow interaction and input from the user whereas static websites need to be updated by the content creator or admin of the website. Another way to define static and dymanic websites are that static websites provide the same content for all users whereas dynamic websites will change depending on algorithms generated by a web application to draw on specific user metadata. Classic examples of dynamic websites are online marketplaces, social media platforms, and search engines. Every time you log in to a social media account the content you view will change depending on a variety of metadata associated with your profile. This is also the case when you search for restaurants in search engines which geolocate depending on IP address. 

Jekyll is software that helps you create a static website. Jekyll takes page templates combined with other files with specific information (e.g., a file for a blog post on the site) to generate full HTML pages for website visitors to see. Jekyll doesn’t need to do anything like querying a database and creating a new HTML page when you visit a webpage; it’s already got the HTML pages fully formed, and it just updates them when or if they ever change.

Since static sites are simply text files, you can easily version a static site to keep track of the different versions of the site over time and see how they have been altered. Versioning is especially helpful when you need to merge two files (e.g., you update your public research data and you want to combine multiple versions), or when you want compare files to look for differences among them (e.g., “How did the research project statement this project in year 1?”). Versioning is great when working with a team (e.g., helps you combine and track different people’s work), but it’s also useful when writing or running a website on your own. GitHub and the programming language Git are excellent at keeping track of versions when managing your static site and its content.

For digital research, static websites are extremely useful as they are a simple way to document the versions of your project using small amounts of data. This is critical if you intend to disseminate your research to communities with low internet band-width and preserve the project with little to no maintenance.
