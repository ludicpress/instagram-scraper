Welcome to my website for how to build an archive of Twitter data using the command line tool twarc in digital research! You will notice there are several sections to the website, including:

* The [About](https://ludicpress.github.io/twarc/about/) page explains what is twarc and why you can use it for digital research;  
* The [Resources](https://ludicpress.github.io/twarc/resources/) page provides some additional tutorial documentation for twarc as well as recources on ethics and copyright of social media content;  
* The [Setup](https://ludicpress.github.io/twarc/setup/) page covers installation guidelines for Linux, Windows, and OS X users as well as creating an application as a Twitter developer; and  
* The [Workshop](https://ludicpress.github.io/twarc/workshop/) page outlines how to configure twarc with your Twitter app's API and goes through a few exercises in building an archive of Twitter data using some of twarc's commands.

Each time there is a significant update to the content on this website I will create a blog post outlining the changes. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
